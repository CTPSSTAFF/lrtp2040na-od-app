# lrtp2040na-od-app
Origin/destination app for LRTP 2040 Needs Assessment

The source code for this app was originally written by Mary McShane for the 2014 LRTP using OpenLayers version 2. 

It was migrated to OpenLayers version 3 by Ethan Ebinger in 2017. 

In 2018 it was (minimally) modified by Ben Krepp to read data from a PostGIS data source rather than an Oracle/ArcGIS datasource.
